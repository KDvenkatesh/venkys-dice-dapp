# 🎲 Petra Dice Roll DApp

## ⭐ Project Description

Petra Dice Roll is a Web3 decentralized application (DApp) built on the **Aptos blockchain**. It enables users to connect their **Petra Wallet**, interact with an on-chain dice game, and receive the results of the roll through blockchain transactions. The app combines fun, interactivity, and blockchain education in one lightweight DApp.

## ⭐ Project Vision

- Provide an easy-to-understand, gamified introduction to Web3 and Aptos blockchain.

## ⭐ Future Scope
